# alphameticRiddleSolver
This is the first program, that I've written, even before university. It solves an alphametic math riddle, consisting of three variables: v1, v2 and the solution. It does not support more variables! (see constructor).  If you want to know everything about this program, I've made a PDF, that you can access here (GitHub): [Documentation](documents/AlphameticRiddleSolverInformation.pdf)
