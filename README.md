# alphameticRiddleSolver
This is the first program, that I've written even before university. It solves an alphametic math riddle, consisting of three variables: v1, v2 and the solution. It does not support more variables! (see constructor).  If you want to know everything about this program, I've made a PDF, that I've uploaded to my website (https://kleinworkspace.com).
